! Routines to test colocated schemes for Low Mach model time integration.
! Test cases:
! 1. taylor_green_vortex.m : Test overall accuracy on structured grids with Nx x Ny cells.
!    Same parameters as ns2d set of verification cases in FDS_Verification_Guide.pdf.
!    Performs 2 tests : a) L2 error norm of momentum at T_end over the whole domain.
!                       b) RMS error of U-Velocity in center point over all time integration steps,
!                          (same as done in the FDS verification guide).
